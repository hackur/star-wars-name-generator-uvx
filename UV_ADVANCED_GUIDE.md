## 1. Lock Files and Reproducible Builds

### Understanding uv.lock

The `uv.lock` file is UV's secret weapon for deterministic, reproducible builds across all environments.

#### Lock File Structure

```toml
version = 1
revision = 1
requires-python = ">=3.9"
resolution-markers = [
    "python_full_version >= '3.10'",
    "python_full_version < '3.10'",
]

[[package]]
name = "click"
version = "8.3.0"
source = { registry = "https://pypi.org/simple" }
resolution-markers = [
    "python_full_version >= '3.10'",
]
dependencies = [
    { name = "colorama", marker = "python_full_version >= '3.10' and sys_platform == 'win32'" },
]
sdist = { url = "...", hash = "sha256:..." }
wheels = [
    { url = "...", hash = "sha256:..." },
]
```

#### Key Features

**Universal Lock Files**
- Single `uv.lock` works across ALL platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Captures platform-specific dependencies automatically
- Contains resolution markers for Python versions and OS variations

**Cryptographic Hashes**
- Every package includes SHA256 hashes for security
- Validates integrity during installation
- Prevents supply chain attacks

**Transitive Dependencies**
- Captures entire dependency tree, not just direct dependencies
- Includes exact versions of all sub-dependencies
- Resolves "dependency of dependency" version conflicts

### Lock File Workflow

#### Development Workflow

```bash
# Initial project setup
uv init my-project
cd my-project

# Add dependencies (auto-updates lock file)
uv add requests pandas

# Lock file is automatically created/updated
git add uv.lock pyproject.toml
git commit -m "feat: add data processing dependencies"

# Team member pulls changes
git pull
uv sync  # Installs EXACT versions from uv.lock
```

#### Lock File Commands

```bash
# Generate/update lock file
uv lock

# Check if lock file is up-to-date (fails if not)
uv lock --check

# Check if lock file exists (doesn't validate it's current)
uv lock --check-exists

# Upgrade all dependencies
uv lock --upgrade

# Upgrade specific packages
uv lock --upgrade-package requests --upgrade-package pandas

# Perform dry run without writing
uv lock --dry-run

# Lock without consulting tool.uv.sources (for publishing)
uv lock --no-sources
```

#### CI/CD Lock File Best Practices

```bash
# In CI: Use --frozen to prevent lock file changes
uv sync --frozen

# In CI: Use --locked to fail if lock file is outdated
uv sync --locked

# Validates lock file matches pyproject.toml
# Ensures reproducible builds
```

### PEP 751 and pylock.toml

UV is moving toward PEP 751 support for interoperability with other tools.

#### Export to pylock.toml

```bash
# Export UV lock to standard format
uv export --format pylock > pylock.toml

# pylock.toml is human-readable and tool-agnostic
# Can be installed by other PEP 751-compliant tools
```

#### Key Differences

| Feature | uv.lock | pylock.toml |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Format | UV-specific | PEP 751 standard |
| Cross-platform | Yes | Yes |
| Tool support | UV only | Any PEP 751 tool |
| Graph representation | Full dependency graph | Fixed marker per package |
| Workspace support | Full | Limited |
| Status (2025) | Primary | Export format |

**Current Status (2025)**: UV uses `uv.lock` natively but can export to `pylock.toml` for interoperability. PEP 751 was accepted in March 2025 and is becoming the ecosystem standard.

### Advanced Lock File Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Library Testing Against Minimum Versions

```bash
# Test library against lowest compatible versions
uv lock --resolution lowest-direct

# Ensures your library works with oldest declared versions
# Critical for library authors to avoid overly restrictive requirements
```

#### Scenario 2: Resolving Dependency Conflicts

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "package-a>=1.0",  # Requires dep-x>=2.0
    "package-b>=2.0",  # Requires dep-x<2.0
]

# Use overrides to force resolution
[tool.uv]
override-dependencies = [
    "dep-x>=2.0,<3.0",  # Override conflicting constraint
]
```

#### Scenario 3: Pre-release Testing

```bash
# Allow pre-release versions during resolution
uv lock --prerelease allow

# Only use pre-releases when necessary
uv lock --prerelease if-necessary

# Explicitly require pre-releases
uv lock --prerelease explicit
```

---

## 2. Virtual Environment Management

### UV's Virtual Environment Philosophy

UV manages virtual environments automatically but gives you fine-grained control when needed.

### Project-Based Virtual Environments

```bash
# UV automatically creates .venv/ when you run:
uv sync

# .venv/ is automatically used by uv run
uv run python script.py

# No need to activate! UV handles it transparently
```

### Manual Virtual Environment Control

```bash
# Create venv manually
uv venv .venv

# Create with specific Python version
uv venv --python 3.11

# Create with system site packages
uv venv --system-site-packages

# Use specific seed packages
uv venv --seed
```

### Environment Variables for Control

```bash
# Force UV to use system Python (no auto-creation)
export UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON=1

# Specify Python version
export UV_PYTHON=3.11

# Disable Python downloads
export UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS=never

# Use active virtualenv instead of project .venv
uv sync --active
```

### Advanced Virtual Environment Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Multiple Python Versions in Same Project

```bash
# Test with Python 3.9
uv run --python 3.9 pytest

# Test with Python 3.12
uv run --python 3.12 pytest

# UV downloads Python versions as needed
# Stored in ~/.local/share/uv/python/
```

#### Pattern 2: Isolated Tool Environments

```bash
# Install tool in isolated environment
uv tool install black

# Tool is isolated from project dependencies
# Located in ~/.local/share/uv/tools/

# List installed tools
uv tool list

# Upgrade tool
uv tool upgrade black

# Uninstall tool
uv tool uninstall black
```

#### Pattern 3: Ephemeral Environments (UVX)

```bash
# Run without installation (ephemeral environment)
uvx black .
uvx pytest
uvx mkdocs serve

# Each invocation:
# 1. Creates temporary venv
# 2. Installs package
# 3. Runs command
# 4. Cleans up

# Cached for performance, but conceptually ephemeral
```

### Environment Best Practices (2025)

**DO:**
- Let UV manage virtual environments automatically
- Use `uv run` instead of activating environments
- Pin Python versions with `.python-version` file
- Use `uv tool install` for CLI tools you use regularly
- Use `uvx` for one-off tool executions

**DON'T:**
- Manually activate virtual environments in scripts
- Mix UV-managed and manually-managed environments
- Commit `.venv/` to version control
- Install project dependencies globally

---

## 3. Dependency Resolution Strategies

UV provides powerful, configurable dependency resolution strategies.

### Resolution Strategies

#### 1. Highest (Default)

```bash
# Default: Latest compatible version
uv lock --resolution highest

# Example:
# package-x>=1.0,<3.0 → Resolves to 2.9.1 (latest)
```

**Use when:**
- Developing applications
- Want latest features and bug fixes
- Following semantic versioning practices

#### 2. Lowest

```bash
# Resolve to lowest compatible versions
uv lock --resolution lowest

# Example:
# package-x>=1.0,<3.0 → Resolves to 1.0.0
```

**Use when:**
- Testing backwards compatibility
- Ensuring minimum version requirements are correct
- Conservative stability requirements

#### 3. Lowest-Direct

```bash
# Lowest for direct deps, highest for transitive
uv lock --resolution lowest-direct

# Example:
# Direct dependency: package-x>=1.0,<3.0 → 1.0.0
# Transitive dependency: package-y>=2.0 → 2.9.1
```

**Use when:**
- You're a library author
- Testing against minimum supported versions
- Want latest bug fixes in transitive dependencies

### Fork Strategies

UV can select different package versions for different Python versions/platforms.

#### Requires-Python (Default)

```bash
uv lock --fork-strategy requires-python

# Optimizes for latest versions per Python version
# Minimizes versions across platforms
```

#### Fewest

```bash
uv lock --fork-strategy fewest

# Minimizes number of selected versions
# Prefers older versions compatible with more platforms
```

### Dependency Overrides

#### Override Constraints

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.uv]
override-dependencies = [
    # Force newer version than package declares
    "pydantic>=2.0,<3.0",

    # Override incorrect upper bound
    "numpy>=1.20,<2.0",
]
```

**Use cases:**
- Package has incorrect version constraints
- You've tested newer versions work
- Resolving impossible-to-satisfy conflicts

#### Constraints (Additive Only)

```toml
[tool.uv]
constraint-dependencies = [
    # Add additional constraints without overriding
    "requests<2.32",  # Security restriction
    "pandas>=2.0",    # Performance requirement
]
```

**Difference from overrides:**
- Constraints are additive (can only narrow, not expand)
- Overrides can expand version ranges
- Use constraints when you want to restrict, not replace

### Advanced Resolution Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Resolving Circular Dependencies

```toml
# Workspace members with circular dev dependencies
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = ["package-a", "package-b"]

# package-a/pyproject.toml
[project]
dependencies = ["package-b"]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = ["package-b[dev]"]

# UV handles this automatically in workspaces
```

#### Scenario 2: Private Package Indexes

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.uv]
index-url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
extra-index-url = [
    "https://private.repo.company.com/simple",
]

# Or via environment
# UV_INDEX_URL=https://private.repo.company.com/simple

# Or via command
# uv sync --index https://private.repo.company.com/simple
```

#### Scenario 3: Git Dependencies

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "my-lib @ git+https://github.com/user/repo.git@v1.0.0",
]

[tool.uv.sources]
my-lib = { git = "https://github.com/user/repo.git", tag = "v1.0.0" }
```

#### Scenario 4: Local Path Dependencies

```toml
[project]
dependencies = ["my-local-lib"]

[tool.uv.sources]
my-local-lib = { path = "../my-local-lib", editable = true }
```

---

## 4. Multi-Platform Compatibility

UV's lock files are inherently cross-platform, but you can fine-tune platform support.

### Cross-Platform Lock Files

```bash
# Generated on macOS, works on Linux/Windows
uv lock

# Lock file contains resolutions for ALL platforms
# Even platforms you're not currently using
```

#### Lock File Platform Markers

```toml
[[package]]
name = "some-package"
version = "1.0.0"
resolution-markers = [
    "sys_platform == 'darwin'",    # macOS
    "sys_platform == 'linux'",     # Linux
    "sys_platform == 'win32'",     # Windows
]
```

### Platform-Specific Dependencies

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "pywin32; sys_platform == 'win32'",
    "pyobjc; sys_platform == 'darwin'",
    "python-dbus; sys_platform == 'linux'",
]
```

### Constraining Supported Platforms

```toml
# Only support Linux and macOS
[tool.uv]
environments = [
    "sys_platform == 'linux'",
    "sys_platform == 'darwin'",
]

# This narrows resolution space and lock file size
```

### Multi-Python Version Support

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project]
requires-python = ">=3.9"

# Lock file will contain resolutions for:
# - Python 3.9
# - Python 3.10
# - Python 3.11
# - Python 3.12
# - Python 3.13 (if available)
```

### Platform-Specific Resolution

```bash
# Resolve for specific platform (from any OS)
uv lock --platform linux
uv lock --platform macos
uv lock --platform windows

# Useful for testing cross-platform compatibility
```

### Advanced Platform Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: ARM vs x86 Compatibility

```toml
# Support both architectures
[tool.uv]
environments = [
    "platform_machine == 'x86_64'",
    "platform_machine == 'aarch64'",  # ARM64
    "platform_machine == 'arm64'",    # Apple Silicon
]
```

#### Scenario 2: Python Implementation Constraints

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "numpy>=1.20",                           # All implementations
    "pypy-specific-lib; implementation_name == 'pypy'",
    "cpython-only; implementation_name == 'cpython'",
]
```

#### Scenario 3: Building Universal Wheels

```bash
# Build wheel that works across platforms
uv build

# Produces:
# dist/my_package-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
#                      ^^^ ^^^^ ^^^
#                       |    |    +-- any platform
#                       |    +------- pure Python (no ABI)
#                       +------------ Python 3
```

## 5. CI/CD Integration Patterns

### GitHub Actions

#### Complete GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install UV
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5
        with:
          enable-cache: true
          cache-dependency-glob: "uv.lock"

      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        run: uv python install ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: uv sync --frozen --all-extras

      - name: Run tests
        run: uv run pytest --cov

      - name: Run type checking
        run: uv run mypy src/

      - name: Build package
        run: uv build

      - name: Prune cache for CI
        run: uv cache prune --ci

  publish:
    needs: test
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install UV
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5

      - name: Build package
        run: uv build

      - name: Publish to PyPI
        env:
          UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
        run: uv publish
```

#### GitHub Actions Best Practices

**Cache Strategy:**
```yaml
- uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5
  with:
    enable-cache: true
    cache-dependency-glob: "uv.lock"
    # Cache persists between workflow runs
    # Keyed on uv.lock contents
```

**Matrix Testing:**
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ["3.9", "3.12"]
    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
```

**Fail Fast:**
```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false  # Continue testing other versions if one fails
```

### GitLab CI/CD

#### Complete GitLab CI Configuration

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
image: ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.6.14-python3.12-bookworm

variables:
  # Critical for GitLab CI - uses separate mountpoint
  UV_LINK_MODE: copy
  # Enable bytecode compilation for faster runtime
  UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE: "1"
  # Cache directory
  UV_CACHE_DIR: .uv-cache
  # Prevent modification of lock file
  UV_FROZEN: "1"

deploy:pypi:
  stage: deploy
  only:
    - tags
  script:
    - uv publish
  variables:
    UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN: $PYPI_API_TOKEN
```

#### GitLab CI Best Practices

**Link Mode:**
```yaml
variables:
  # CRITICAL: GitLab CI uses separate mountpoint for build directory
  UV_LINK_MODE: copy
  # Without this, hardlinks/symlinks fail across filesystems
```

**Cache Pruning:**
```yaml
after_script:
  - uv cache prune --ci
  # Removes pre-built wheels, keeps source-built wheels
  # Reduces cache size significantly
```

### Jenkins Integration

```groovy
// Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        UV_CACHE_DIR = "${WORKSPACE}/.uv-cache"
    }

    stages {
        stage('Setup') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
                    export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
                    uv --version
                '''
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                    uv sync --frozen
                    uv run pytest
                '''
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'uv build'
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'dist/*', fingerprint: true
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            sh 'uv cache prune --ci'
        }
    }
}
```

### CI/CD Performance Comparison (2025 Benchmarks)

| Setup | Install Time | Build Time | Total Time |
|-------|--------------|------------|------------|
| pip + venv | 5m 15s | 45s | 6m 0s |
| Poetry | 3m 30s | 40s | 4m 10s |
| **UV** | **25s** | **30s** | **55s** |

**Improvement: 85% faster than pip, 78% faster than Poetry**

## 6. Performance Optimization

### Understanding UV's Speed

UV achieves 10-100x speed improvements through several architectural innovations:

#### 1. Rust Implementation
- Zero-copy operations where possible
- Parallel dependency resolution
- Efficient memory management

#### 2. HTTP Range Requests
```bash
# Traditional pip: Downloads entire wheel (50MB)
# UV: Range request for metadata only (~5KB)
# Saves 99.99% bandwidth during resolution
```

#### 3. Global Cache with Linking
```bash
# Traditional pip: Copies files to each venv
# UV: Hard links/reflinks to global cache
# Disk usage: O(1) instead of O(n)
```

### Performance Optimization Techniques

#### Technique 1: Link Mode Selection

```bash
# Hardlink (fastest, least space, default)
uv sync --link-mode hardlink

# Clone (copy-on-write, fast on APFS/btrfs)
uv sync --link-mode clone

# Symlink (fast, but some tools don't support)
uv sync --link-mode symlink

# Copy (slowest, most compatible)
uv sync --link-mode copy  # Required for GitLab CI
```

**Recommendation:**
- **Local dev**: Use default (hardlink)
- **Docker**: Use hardlink or clone
- **GitLab CI**: Use copy (required)
- **Network drives**: Use copy

#### Technique 2: Bytecode Compilation

```bash
# Compile to bytecode during install
uv sync --compile-bytecode

# Benefits:
# - Faster import times (no .pyc compilation at runtime)
# - Smaller runtime overhead
# - Critical for lambda/serverless environments
```

#### Technique 3: Dependency Groups

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = ["pytest", "mypy", "ruff"]
docs = ["mkdocs", "mkdocs-material"]
lint = ["ruff", "black"]

# Install only what you need
[dependency-groups]
# New PEP 735 format (UV 0.5+)
test = ["pytest", "pytest-cov"]
type = ["mypy", "types-requests"]
```

```bash
# Development: Install everything
uv sync --all-extras

# Production: No extras
uv sync

# CI Testing: Only test dependencies
uv sync --group test

# CI Linting: Only lint dependencies
uv sync --group lint
```

#### Technique 4: Exclude Newer Packages

```bash
# Only consider packages uploaded before date
uv lock --exclude-newer 2025-01-01

# Benefits:
# - Reproducible across time
# - Avoid newly broken packages
# - Security: avoid supply chain attacks from compromised packages
```

#### Technique 5: Parallel Operations

UV automatically parallelizes operations, but you can tune:

```bash
# UV uses all available CPUs by default
# No configuration needed

# Operations parallelized:
# - Dependency resolution
# - Package downloads
# - Wheel builds
# - Installation
```

### Benchmarking Your Project

```bash
# Measure cold install (no cache)
rm -rf .uv-cache .venv
time uv sync

# Measure warm install (with cache)
rm -rf .venv
time uv sync

# Measure incremental sync
time uv sync  # Should be near-instant
```

## 7. Caching Strategies

### UV's Global Cache Architecture

```
~/.cache/uv/
├── wheels/           # Extracted wheel contents
│   ├── v1/
│   │   ├── pypi/
│   │   │   ├── click/8.3.0/
│   │   │   └── requests/2.31.0/
├── built-wheels/     # Wheels built from source
├── git/              # Git repository clones
├── interpreter/      # Python interpreters
└── archive-v0/       # Downloaded archives
```

### Cache Management

#### Cache Commands

```bash
# Show cache directory
uv cache dir

# Show cache size
du -sh $(uv cache dir)

# Clean entire cache
uv cache clean

# Clean specific package
uv cache clean requests

# Prune unreachable objects
uv cache prune

# Prune for CI (remove pre-built wheels)
uv cache prune --ci
```

#### Cache Best Practices by Environment

##### Local Development

```bash
# Keep full cache
uv sync

# Periodically clean old versions
uv cache prune  # Keeps only reachable packages
```

##### Docker Builds

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile with cache mount
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Copy UV from official image
COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /usr/local/bin/uv

WORKDIR /app

# Layer 1: Dependencies (cached unless uv.lock changes)
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv \
    uv sync --frozen --no-dev

# Layer 2: Application code (changes frequently)
COPY . .

# Layer 3: Install project
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv \
    uv sync --frozen --no-dev --no-editable
```

**Benefits:**
- Cache persists across builds
- Significantly faster rebuilds
- Reduced bandwidth usage

##### GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Setup UV
  uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5
  with:
    enable-cache: true
    cache-dependency-glob: "uv.lock"
    # Automatic cache management
```

##### GitLab CI

```yaml
variables:
  UV_CACHE_DIR: .uv-cache

cache:
  key:
    files:
      - uv.lock
  paths:
    - .uv-cache

after_script:
  - uv cache prune --ci
```

### Advanced Caching Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Monorepo with Shared Cache

```yaml
# .github/workflows/monorepo.yml
jobs:
  test-package-a:
    steps:
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5
        with:
          enable-cache: true
          cache-dependency-glob: "**/uv.lock"
          # Matches all uv.lock files in workspace

  test-package-b:
    steps:
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5
        with:
          enable-cache: true
          cache-dependency-glob: "**/uv.lock"
          # Shares cache with package-a
```

#### Scenario 2: Multi-Architecture Builds

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    arch: [amd64, arm64]

- name: Setup UV
  uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5
  with:
    enable-cache: true
    cache-dependency-glob: "uv.lock"
    cache-suffix: ${{ matrix.arch }}
    # Separate cache per architecture
```

#### Scenario 3: Cache Warming

```bash
# Pre-populate cache in CI
uv pip install --no-deps <commonly-used-packages>

# Then run actual sync
uv sync --frozen
```

### Cache Performance Metrics (2025)

| Scenario | No Cache | Warm Cache | Improvement |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Cold install | 45s | 45s | 0% |
| Warm install | 45s | 3s | 93% |
| Rebuild (no changes) | 40s | 0.5s | 98.7% |
| Add one package | 50s | 6s | 88% |

## 8. Workspace and Monorepo Patterns

### Understanding UV Workspaces

Workspaces allow you to manage multiple related packages with a single lock file.

#### Workspace Structure

```
my-monorepo/
├── pyproject.toml          # Workspace root
├── uv.lock                 # Single lock file for entire workspace
├── packages/
│   ├── package-a/
│   │   ├── pyproject.toml
│   │   └── src/
│   ├── package-b/
│   │   ├── pyproject.toml
│   │   └── src/
│   └── package-c/
│       ├── pyproject.toml
│       └── src/
└── apps/
    ├── api/
    │   ├── pyproject.toml
    │   └── src/
    └── cli/
        ├── pyproject.toml
        └── src/
```

### Configuring Workspaces

#### Root pyproject.toml

```toml
# pyproject.toml (workspace root)
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = [
    "packages/*",
    "apps/*",
]
exclude = [
    "packages/experimental",
]

[project]
name = "my-monorepo"
version = "1.0.0"
requires-python = ">=3.9"

# Shared dependencies for all workspace members
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.0",
    "mypy>=1.0",
    "ruff>=0.1",
]
```

#### Workspace Member Configuration

```toml
# packages/package-a/pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "package-a"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.31",
    "package-b",  # Dependency on another workspace member
]

[tool.uv.sources]
package-b = { workspace = true }  # Use workspace version
```

```toml
# packages/package-b/pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "package-b"
version = "0.2.0"
dependencies = [
    "click>=8.0",
]
```

```toml
# apps/api/pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "api"
version = "1.0.0"
dependencies = [
    "fastapi>=0.110",
    "package-a",  # Depends on workspace library
    "package-b",  # Depends on workspace library
]

[tool.uv.sources]
package-a = { workspace = true }
package-b = { workspace = true }
```

### Workspace Commands

```bash
# Lock entire workspace
uv lock
# Generates single uv.lock for all members

# Sync workspace root
uv sync

# Sync specific workspace member
uv sync --package package-a

# Sync all workspace members
uv sync --all-packages

# Run command in specific member
uv run --package api python -m api.main

# Build specific member
uv build --package package-a

# Build all members
uv build --all-packages
```

### Workspace Dependency Management

#### Shared Dependencies

```toml
# Root pyproject.toml
[tool.uv]
constraint-dependencies = [
    # Enforce consistent versions across workspace
    "numpy>=1.26,<2.0",
    "pandas>=2.0,<3.0",
]
```

#### Override Dependencies in Members

```toml
# packages/package-a/pyproject.toml
[tool.uv.sources]
# Override specific dependency for this member
numpy = { git = "https://github.com/numpy/numpy.git", rev = "main" }
```

### Advanced Workspace Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Layered Architecture

```
workspace/
├── pyproject.toml
├── libs/              # Core libraries (no dependencies on apps)
│   ├── core/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── models/
├── services/          # Business logic (depends on libs)
│   ├── auth/
│   └── data/
└── apps/              # Applications (depends on services + libs)
    ├── api/
    └── cli/
```

```toml
# libs/core/pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "core"
dependencies = []  # No internal dependencies

# services/auth/pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "auth"
dependencies = ["core"]

[tool.uv.sources]
core = { workspace = true }

# apps/api/pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "api"
dependencies = ["auth", "core"]

[tool.uv.sources]
auth = { workspace = true }
core = { workspace = true }
```

#### Pattern 2: Plugin Architecture

```toml
# Root pyproject.toml
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = [
    "core",
    "plugins/*",
]

# core/pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "app-core"
version = "1.0.0"

[project.entry-points."app.plugins"]
# Core provides plugin interface

# plugins/plugin-a/pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "plugin-a"
dependencies = ["app-core"]

[project.entry-points."app.plugins"]
plugin_a = "plugin_a:Plugin"

[tool.uv.sources]
app-core = { workspace = true }
```

#### Pattern 3: Multi-Application Workspace

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = [
    "shared/*",
    "apps/web",
    "apps/mobile-backend",
    "apps/worker",
]

# Shared libraries
# apps/web/pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "web"
dependencies = [
    "shared-auth",
    "shared-db",
    "shared-models",
]

[tool.uv.sources]
shared-auth = { workspace = true }
shared-db = { workspace = true }
shared-models = { workspace = true }
```

### Workspace Testing Strategy

```bash
# Test entire workspace
uv run --all-packages pytest

# Test specific package
uv run --package package-a pytest

# Test with coverage across workspace
uv run --all-packages pytest --cov=packages --cov=apps

# Type check entire workspace
uv run --all-packages mypy .
```

### Workspace CI/CD Strategy

```yaml
# .github/workflows/workspace.yml
name: Workspace CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  # Test all packages in parallel
  test-packages:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        package: [package-a, package-b, package-c]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5
        with:
          enable-cache: true
          cache-dependency-glob: "uv.lock"

      - name: Sync workspace
        run: uv sync --frozen

      - name: Test ${{ matrix.package }}
        run: uv run --package ${{ matrix.package }} pytest

  # Build all packages
  build:
    needs: test-packages
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5

      - name: Build all packages
        run: uv build --all-packages

      - name: Upload artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: dist
          path: dist/
```

### Workspace Publishing Strategy

```bash
# Publish specific package
uv publish --package package-a

# Publish all packages (with proper ordering)
# UV automatically determines correct order based on dependencies
uv publish --all-packages
```

### Workspace Limitations (2025)

**Known Limitations:**
1. Circular dependencies between workspace members trigger errors
2. Each member must have unique package name
3. Workspace members must be on local filesystem (no Git URLs)
4. Can't exclude specific transitive dependencies per member

**Workarounds:**
1. Restructure to avoid circular dependencies (use dependency inversion)
2. Ensure unique naming conventions (e.g., `myorg-package-name`)
3. Use Git submodules if needed, but workspace members must be local
4. Use `override-dependencies` at workspace root

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Lock File Out of Sync

```bash
# Symptom: uv sync fails with "lock file out of sync"
# Solution:
uv lock  # Regenerate lock file
uv sync

# Or in CI:
uv sync --locked  # Fails if lock file is outdated
```

#### Issue 2: Dependency Resolution Conflicts

```bash
# Symptom: "Unable to resolve dependencies"
# Solution 1: Use overrides
[tool.uv]
override-dependencies = ["problematic-package>=2.0"]

# Solution 2: Lower resolution strategy
uv lock --resolution lowest-direct

# Solution 3: Allow pre-releases
uv lock --prerelease if-necessary
```

#### Issue 3: Slow Resolution in CI

```bash
# Symptom: Resolution takes minutes in CI
# Solution: Use --frozen to skip resolution
uv sync --frozen  # Uses existing lock file only
```

#### Issue 4: Cache Corruption

```bash
# Symptom: Strange errors during installation
# Solution:
uv cache clean  # Clean entire cache
uv sync --refresh  # Refresh all cached data
```

#### Issue 5: Platform-Specific Build Failures

```bash
# Symptom: Wheel build fails on specific platform
# Solution: Skip building for that package
uv sync --no-build-package problematic-package
# Uses pre-built wheel only
```

## Performance Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure optimal UV performance:

- [ ] Commit `uv.lock` to version control
- [ ] Use `--frozen` in CI/CD
- [ ] Enable cache in CI (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI)
- [ ] Run `uv cache prune --ci` at end of CI jobs
- [ ] Use `--compile-bytecode` for production builds
- [ ] Use appropriate `--link-mode` for your environment
- [ ] Pin Python version with `.python-version`
- [ ] Use dependency groups to minimize installs
- [ ] Enable Docker cache mounts for container builds
- [ ] Use `--all-packages` for workspace-wide operations
- [ ] Avoid `--upgrade` in CI (use explicit version bumps)
- [ ] Use `--refresh-package` instead of `--refresh` when possible

---

## Security Best Practices

### Dependency Security

```bash
# Use hash checking (automatic with uv.lock)
uv sync --locked

# Restrict to packages before a date (avoid supply chain attacks)
uv lock --exclude-newer 2025-01-01

# Use private indexes for sensitive dependencies
uv sync --index https://private.company.com/simple

# Verify package hashes
cat uv.lock | grep "hash ="
```

### Environment Variables for Security

```bash
# Never log tokens
export UV_NO_PROGRESS=1  # Disable progress bars (less info leak)

# Use token from environment, not command line
export UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN="pypi-..."
uv publish  # Token not visible in process list

# Validate certificates
unset UV_INSECURE_HOST  # Ensure not set
```

---

## Future-Proofing (2025 and Beyond)

### Upcoming Features

**PEP 751 (pylock.toml)**
- Full support planned for 2025
- Will enable interoperability with other tools
- `uv export --format pylock` already available

**PEP 735 (Dependency Groups)**
- Replaces `optional-dependencies` for dev deps
- Already supported in UV 0.5+

```toml
[dependency-groups]
test = ["pytest>=7.0"]
lint = ["ruff>=0.1"]
```

**Enhanced Workspace Features**
- Better circular dependency handling
- Workspace-wide constraint inheritance
- Per-member Python version support

### Migration Path

**From pip + requirements.txt:**
```bash
uv init --legacy  # Import from requirements.txt
uv sync
```

**From Poetry:**
```bash
uv init  # UV reads poetry.lock
uv sync
```

**From Pipenv:**
```bash
uv init  # UV reads Pipfile.lock
uv sync
```
